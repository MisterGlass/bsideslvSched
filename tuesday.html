        <span class='title'>Practical Application Whitelisting Evasion</span>
        <p class='description'>Organizations continue to tout Application Whitelisting as one of the best counter-measures to deploy. We have developed several evasion techniques that put organizations at risk that use Application Whitelisting. We would like to share these techniques, and engage in dialogue about ways to improve or expand our research. </p>

        <span class='title'>The Internet of ... Mainframes?! WTF?</span>
        <p class='description'>In early 2013 Soldier of Fortran had an idea. What if there were mainframes on the internet? He knew, of course, there had to be, the internet is just full of all kinds of weird stuff. But what if there’s also mainframes on there, what would that mean? What would they look like? Using some google fu he started the hunt, easily finding a handful, then later moving on to SHODAN and finally masscan. Having grown up in the BBS era he was happy to find hundreds of ‘green’ screens up and running with their beautiful EBCDIC art for all the world to see. This talk will walk through the story of how he found the mainframes, first by himself and later with the help of others. He’ll go through the growth process he went through to find the mainframes and how he helped augment tools like SHODAN to make the hunting easier. He’ll detail the tools he wrote specifically to hunt internet mainframes, the troubles he’s gotten in to for looking for them (like when someone came up to me after a talk to tell me it was one of theirs) and then provide MANY examples of the the kind of (scary) things he’s encountered on the web. He’ll also delve into some of the alarming statistics of mainframe security using what he’s seen as an example. There may even be some live examples of some of those mainframes. </p>

        <span class='title'>Hacking Our Way Into Hacking</span>
        <p class='description'>It may seem like everyone in infosec has always been a hacker. However, many of us have come to hacking from other industries, and as we make our way through the infosec community it’s often hard to find others like us. This is a conversation for every hacker who started as a mechanic, a kindergarten teacher, or a gender studies major: let’s talk about where we came from, how we got here, and some of the unique challenges we’ve come across as hackers with “past lives”.</p>

        <span class='title'>Stress, Burnout, Rinse, Repeat</span>
        <p class='description'>Stories of burnout in tech professionals are not rare, particularly in security pros. Building on the earlier work of the stress and burnout project team which presented at BSidesLV 2011 and RSA USA 2012 and adding new voices, perspectives, and research this panel will explore what we have learned about warning signs, prevention, support, and recovery- and what remains to be done. This will be a highly personal and conversational discussion. While this topic needs public discussion, we are submitting to the Underground track to encourage candid discussions which might be stifled by public exposure. </p>
